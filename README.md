# LVC-plotter

Dan Villarreal, University of Pittsburgh

This repo hosts a Shiny app that facilitates easy plotting of results for
final projects for the class Linguistic Variation & Change (LING 1269) at the
University of Pittsburgh. The app takes a csv of LVC data as input and creates a
plot of results using `ggplot2`. This allows students to create professional-
looking plots without needing to know any coding.
